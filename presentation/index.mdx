<Notes>
  HyperCard was peer-to-peer over AppleTalk. State was shared between the peers,
  and it was easy to get out of sync. It wasn't very powerful or expressive, but
  got the job done and was easy to learn.

<img src={require("../assets/livecode-screenshot.jpg")} />

<Notes>
  LiveCode was fancier than Hypercard, with animations, full-color graphics, and
  TCP/IP for networking. Still easy to learn, but also not super expressive.

# Next Generation of Controls

<img src={require("../assets/tng.webp")} />

<Notes>
  While HyperCard and LiveCode served their purpose well, it wasn't enough. More
  simulators were being built, each needing a new, custom set of controls.
  Wouldn't it be nice it we could compose cards together, customized for each
  ship? Wouldn't it be nice if we could centralize data so it didn't get out of
  sync? Wouldn't it be nice if we could offload some of the Flight Directors job
  to the controls so she can focus on giving her crew a great experience? Long
  Duration Missions are becoming a thing. Wouldn't it be nice if we could save
  the state of flights so we can go back to them at a later date?

# Flint

Killed by Committee

<Notes>
  Flint was my last spaceship controls project, and it was good. It was web
  based, built with Meteor JS. But between the incredible ambitions and the rule
  by committee, it was never able to come to a completed state. Instead of
  making it usable, we got buried in the details, so it never saw the light of
  day. But I did learn some important lessons.

# Step 3: Plan

---

- Working in a familiar domain
- Developer experience
- Maintain Momentum. One commit a day

---

- <s>Elixer</s>
- <s>RethinkDB</s>
- <s>Docker</s>
- React
- GraphQL & Apollo

<Notes>
  Without a good developer experience, coming to work on the project is a real
  drag. You never want to do anything with it. The tools you choose to use will
  strongly affect your developer experience.

# I ♥ ⚛️

<Cite>Me</Cite>

<Notes>
  Always bet on React. I've been using it for 3 years, and it's only become more
  joyful to use. Same with GraphQL. Both are excellent tools.

The main reason I started working on Thorium was so I could learn React and
GraphQL. Side projects are an awesome way to learn new things because they give
you the chance to practice what you learn, to make mistakes, and to try new
things in a safe environment.

I believe that if you want to learn anything, using a side project with a
well-defined domain is the best way to do it.

# API Archeology

## HOC ➡ Render Props ➡ Hooks ➡ Suspense

<Notes>
  Being a 3-year old project on the cutting edge means I've seen a lot of
  patterns come and go. Take Apollo's API for example - when I started, there
  were only HOCs. Then the render prop components were added, and they're
  awesome. Now there's a Hooks API, which is even nicer. Maybe by the time I
  give this talk there will be a suspense API 🤞. Fortunately, it's all been
  backwards compatible, but Thorium almost has paleontological layers showing
  the trends as they evolve.
