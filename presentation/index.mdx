# Wonder-driven Development

## "I Wonder If..."

<Notes>
This is characterized by asking the question, "I wonder if...?" and then doing it.

- Curiosity about things they don't understand
- Passion for their work
- Optimism, or the belief that they can find answers

</Notes>

<Notes>

These crew members come for 5th and 6th grade field trips, and the experience
instills in them a sense of wonder. Many of them end up studying STEM topics as
a result.

# Thorium

<Notes>
To help facilitate these experiences, I built Thorium.

Thorium is a central server that browsers connect to. Each browser has a client
ID and can be assigned a crew station, like weapons, navigation, or
communication.

<Notes>
I wondered if I could learn React and GraphQL while making these spaceship controls,
and even wondered if it were possible. The only way for me to find out was to do it,
so I started small, worked a bit every day, and eventually produced a completed product.

What exactly do these spaceship controls entail?

<Notes>
  The flight director also connects with a web browser. They use a special
  control screen called "Core" which gives them at-a-glance access to the state
  of the simulation and the ability to adjust anything as needed.

## I Wonder If...

## Dynamic Crew Stations

<Notes>
  The first problem I have to solve is showing dynamic screens on the crew
  stations. I wondered if I could control what is being shown on the client from
  the server.
</Notes>

---

```GraphQL
 subscription ClientUpdate($clientId: ID!) {
  clientChanged(client: $clientId) {
    simulator {
      id
      name
    }
    station {
      name
        cards {
          name
          component
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

<Notes>
  Create a unique client ID, Subscribe to changes to that client ID, render the
  screen assigned to that station.
</Notes>

---

```JavaScript
import * as Cards from './cards';

function CardComponent({componentName,...props}) {
  const Component = Cards[componentName];
  return <Component {...props} />
}
```

---

## Dynamic Control Grid

<Notes>

I wondered if I can dynamically layout core components that I can easily change
and adjust as necessary. Also have the core feed which gives me actionable
components based on things that happen during the flight. Since it's just
components, and they all load data from the unified Apollo GraphQL cache, it's
really easy to do.

</Notes>

---

# Main Viewscreen

<Notes>
  I wondered if the main viewscreen can be dynamically changed based on the
  state of the simulator.
</Notes>

---

# Mission Timeline &

# Mutation Macros

<Notes>
  I use an introspection query to figure out what GraphQL mutations are able to
  be used as timeline actions, and then set up special configuration for them if
  necessary
</Notes>

---

# Subscription-based Animations

<Notes>
  Server animated contacts at 20fps and LERP on the client. This was just
  playing around with Websockets, animation intervals, and different Linear
  Interpolation methods.
</Notes>

---

## Before

```JavaScript
function useInterpolate(inputs, interval) {
  const [contacts, setContacts] = useState(inputs);
  const endTime = useRef(Date.now() + interval);
  const previousInputs = usePrevious(inputs);
  const inputsRef = useRef(inputs);
  useEffect(() => {
    endTime.current = Date.now() + interval;
    inputsRef.current = inputs;
  }, [inputs, interval]);

useAnimationFrame(() => { let t = Math.max( 0, Math.min(1, Math.abs(1 -
(endTime.current - Date.now()) / interval)) ); const contactIds = contacts.map(c
=> c.id); const inputObj = inputsRef.current.reduce( (acc, c) => ({ ...acc,
[c.id]: c }), {} ); const previousInputObj = previousInputs.reduce( (acc, c) =>
({ ...acc, [c.id]: c }), {} ); const inputIds = Object.keys(inputObj); const
newContacts = inputsRef.current.filter( ({ id }) => contactIds.indexOf(id) ===
-1 ); const filteredContacts = contacts .filter(({ id }) =>
inputIds.indexOf(id) > -1) .map(c => { if (!previousInputObj[c.id] ||
!inputObj[c.id]) return null; return { ...c, ...inputObj[c.id], position: { x:
lerp( previousInputObj[c.id].position.x, inputObj[c.id].position.x, t ), y:
lerp( previousInputObj[c.id].position.y, inputObj[c.id].position.y, t ) } }; })
.filter(Boolean); setContacts(newContacts.concat(filteredContacts)); }); return
contacts; }

```

---

## After

```CSS
.moving-object {
  transform: translate 50ms linear;
}
```

<Notes>
  As it turns out, CSS is way better at interpolating things than JavaScript
