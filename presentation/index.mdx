# Ship Controls

<Notes>
  HyperCard was peer-to-peer over AppleTalk. State was shared between the peers,
  and it was easy to get out of sync. It wasn't very powerful or expressive, but
  got the job done and was easy to learn.
</Notes>

<img src={require("../assets/livecode.png")} />

---

<img src={require("../assets/livecode-screenshot.jpg")} />

<Notes>
  LiveCode was fancier than Hypercard, with animations, full-color graphics, and
  TCP/IP for networking. Still easy to learn, but also not super expressive.

# Next Generation of Controls

<img src={require("../assets/tng.webp")} />

<Notes>
  While HyperCard and LiveCode served their purpose well, it wasn't enough. More
  simulators were being built, each needing a new, custom set of controls.
  Wouldn't it be nice it we could compose cards together, customized for each
  ship? Wouldn't it be nice if we could centralize data so it didn't get out of
  sync? Wouldn't it be nice if we could offload some of the Flight Directors job
  to the controls so she can focus on giving her crew a great experience? Long
  Duration Missions are becoming a thing. Wouldn't it be nice if we could save
  the state of flights so we can go back to them at a later date?
