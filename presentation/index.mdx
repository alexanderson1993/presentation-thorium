<Notes>
  HyperCard was peer-to-peer over AppleTalk. State was shared between the peers,
  and it was easy to get out of sync. It wasn't very powerful or expressive, but
  got the job done and was easy to learn.
</Notes>

---

<img src={require("../assets/livecode.png")} />

---

<img src={require("../assets/livecode-screenshot.jpg")} />

<Notes>
  LiveCode was fancier than Hypercard, with animations, full-color graphics, and
  TCP/IP for networking. Still easy to learn, but also not super expressive.
</Notes>

# Lessons Learned

- Simple can get the job done
- Learnable > Powerful

---

> You don't know what you don't know until you know better.

<Cite>Me</Cite>

---

- Hard to distribute fixes
- Not easily customized
- Fragile, not portable

<Notes>
Since the programs are only local to the computers which run them, and each simulator has custom controls, sharing improvements and bug fixes between the sets of controls is really hard. Changing the controls between simulators is a pain. And the simulator's controls are set up to work in their specific environment, but it's hard to set it up anywhere else. Much better to have one set of controls which can do everything.
</Notes>
---

# Next Generation of Controls

<img src={require("../assets/tng.webp")} />

<Notes>
  While HyperCard and LiveCode served their purpose well, it wasn't enough. More
  simulators were being built, each needing a new, custom set of controls.
  Wouldn't it be nice it we could compose cards together, customized for each
  ship? Wouldn't it be nice if we could centralize data so it didn't get out of
  sync? Wouldn't it be nice if we could offload some of the Flight Directors job
  to the controls so she can focus on giving her crew a great experience? Long
  Duration Missions are becoming a thing. Wouldn't it be nice if we could save
  the state of flights so we can go back to them at a later date?

<Notes>
 Remember back to the hologram probe. That gambit was enabled through the freedom and flexibility afforded by the simulator controls.
 I don't just want the flight director to be free to do surprising things - the crew should be able to surprise the flight director sometimes too.

# Flint

Killed by Committee

<Notes>
  Flint was my last spaceship controls project, and it was good. It was web
  based, built with Meteor JS. But between the incredible ambitions and the rule
  by committee, it was never able to come to a completed state. Instead of
  making it usable, we got buried in the details, so it never saw the light of
  day. But I did learn some important lessons.
</Notes>

## Tethering Constraints

<Notes>
  Like a kite string, constraints in our projects tether us to what we actually
  want and allow us to make continuous progress instead of allowing rampant
  changes, adjustments, suggestions, etc.

# Plan For Success

<ul style={{ marginLeft: "-10vw", width: "80vw", textAlign: "left" }}>
  <li>Working in a familiar domain</li>
  <li>Friendly Developer experience</li>
  <li>Maintain Momentum. One commit a day</li>
</ul>

<Notes>
  I'm a firm believer that good developer experience will yield good user
  experience. I think it's possible to go overboard, but thats why it is
  important to understand your constraints and select tools that can give you
  both.
</Notes>

---

- <s>Elixer</s>
- <s>RethinkDB</s>
- <s>Docker</s>
- React
- GraphQL & Apollo

<Notes>
  Without a good developer experience, coming to work on the project is a real
  drag. You never want to do anything with it. The tools you choose to use will
  strongly affect your developer experience. Elixer, Rethink, and Docker would
  be cool, but would they match my constraints?

# I ‚ô• ‚öõÔ∏è

> Learning @reactjs before fully understanding JavaScript fundamentals is a
> great learning path. Learning React can make your JavaScript skills much
> better than learning JavaScript alone.

<Cite>Me</Cite>

<Notes>
  Always bet on React. I've been using it for 3 years, and it's only become more
  joyful to use. Same with GraphQL. Both are excellent tools.

The main reason I started working on Thorium was so I could learn React and
GraphQL. Side projects are an awesome way to learn new things because they give
you the chance to practice what you learn, to make mistakes, and to try new
things in a safe environment.

I believe that if you want to learn anything, using a side project with a
well-defined domain is the best way to do it.

# API Archeology

<div style={{ marginTop: "60px", marginLeft: "-15vw", width: "80vw" }}>
  <h2>HOC ‚û° Render Props ‚û° Hooks ‚û° Suspense</h2>
</div>

<Notes>
  Being a 3-year old project on the cutting edge means I've seen a lot of
  patterns come and go. Take Apollo's API for example - when I started, there
  were only HOCs. Then the render prop components were added, and they're
  awesome. Now there's a Hooks API, which is even nicer. Maybe by the time I
  give this talk there will be a suspense API ü§û. Fortunately, it's all been
  backwards compatible, but Thorium almost has paleontological layers showing
  the trends as they evolve.

# Staying Accountable

<Notes>
  We are accountable to a lot of people. Our bosses, our customers, our
  families, ourselves. Accountability helps us acomplish the things that we want
  to do. It gives us reason and purpose for making what we make, and can help us
  change course when we go the wrong way.

# Future Plans

<br />
 
Or what I would do if I did it all over again

<Notes>
I would start with a partner or team. And I would think about making it more friendly to more users.

I wrote a list of 10 things that I would do differently if I did it all over
again. I'm going to revisit them in 3 years and see how many stand the tests of
time.

    1. Use TypeScript
    2. Use the latest features of all the frameworks - hooks, suspense, etc.
    3. Use CSS-in-JS so the CSS isn‚Äôt a total nightmare (it‚Äôs not too bad, since it‚Äôs all scoped to cards, but there are still collisions sometimes that cause problems)
    4. More carefully design the GraphQL schema so it‚Äôs consistent.
    5. Make sure subscriptions are more atomic and scoped to just what the subscriber wants (there are currently a LOT of leaky subscriptions)
    6. Do internationalization from the get-go
    7. Do a11y from the get-go
    8. Use a more proper database. My JSON dump works for most peeps, but Ryan Anderson has a MASSIVE snapshot, and his CPU spikes hardcore every time it writes.
    9. Simplify things substantially based on how users actually use Thorium. More sensible defaults, less enterprise-y, less configuration
    10. Write Tests

</Notes>

# Wonder-driven Development

## I wonder if...

<Notes>
  - Subscription-based state management 
  
  - Tracking open web browser tabs

- Node-diagram based configuration

- Dynamic station configuration - showing a component based on data from the
  server

- Mosaic-based dynamic core

- Timeline configuration


    - Dynamic viewscreen & auto-viewscreen
