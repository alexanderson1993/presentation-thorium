<Notes>
  Remember back to the hologram probe. That gambit was enabled through the
  freedom and flexibility afforded by the simulator controls. I don't just want
  the flight director to be free to do surprising things - the crew should be
  able to surprise the flight director sometimes too.

- <s>Elixer</s>
- <s>RethinkDB</s>
- <s>Docker</s>
- React
- GraphQL & Apollo

<Notes>
  I'm a firm believer that good developer experience will yield good user
  experience. I think it's possible to go overboard, but thats why it is
  important to understand your constraints and select tools that can give you
  both.

Without a good developer experience, coming to work on the project is a real
drag. You never want to do anything with it. The tools you choose to use will
strongly affect your developer experience. Elixer, Rethink, and Docker would be
cool, but would they match my constraints?

<Cite>Me</Cite>

<Notes>
  Always bet on React. I've been using it for 3 years, and it's only become more
  joyful to use. Same with GraphQL. Both are excellent tools.

The main reason I started working on Thorium was so I could learn React and
GraphQL. Side projects are an awesome way to learn new things because they give
you the chance to practice what you learn, to make mistakes, and to try new
things in a safe environment.

I believe that if you want to learn anything, using a side project with a
well-defined domain is the best way to do it.

# API Archeology

<div style={{ marginTop: "60px", marginLeft: "-15vw", width: "80vw" }}>
  <h2>HOC ‚û° Render Props ‚û° Hooks ‚û° Suspense</h2>
</div>

<Notes>
  Being a 3-year old project on the cutting edge means I've seen a lot of
  patterns come and go. Take Apollo's API for example - when I started, there
  were only HOCs. Then the render prop components were added, and they're
  awesome. Now there's a Hooks API, which is even nicer. Maybe by the time I
  give this talk there will be a suspense API ü§û. Fortunately, it's all been
  backwards compatible, but Thorium almost has paleontological layers showing
  the trends as they evolve.

# Mission Timeline & Mutation Macros

  I use an introspection query to figure out what GraphQL mutations are able to
  be used as timeline actions, and then set up special configuration for them if
  necessary

# Tracking open web browser tabs

## Multiple clients on one computer

<Notes>
  Since clients store their client ID in localstorage, it's not possible to have
  multiple clients open at the same time... unless I store a list of clients in
  localstorage

<Notes>
  Releasing Thorium meant answering to customers, and they have a lot of things
  to change and ideas for improvement. Staying on top of those, finding time to
  work on them, while prioritizing the most important is really tricky.

# Future Plans

<br />
 
Or what I would do if I did it all over again

<Notes>
I would start with a partner or team. And I would think about making it more friendly to more users.

I wrote a list of 10 things that I would do differently if I did it all over
again. I'm going to revisit them in 3 years and see how many stand the tests of
time.

    1. Use TypeScript
    2. Use the latest features of all the frameworks - hooks, suspense, etc.
    3. Use CSS-in-JS so the CSS isn‚Äôt a total nightmare (it‚Äôs not too bad, since it‚Äôs all scoped to cards, but there are still collisions sometimes that cause problems)
    4. More carefully design the GraphQL schema so it‚Äôs consistent.
    5. Make sure subscriptions are more atomic and scoped to just what the subscriber wants (there are currently a LOT of leaky subscriptions)
    6. Do internationalization from the get-go
    7. Do a11y from the get-go
    8. Use a more proper database. My JSON dump works for most peeps, but Ryan Anderson has a MASSIVE snapshot, and his CPU spikes hardcore every time it writes.
    9. Simplify things substantially based on how users actually use Thorium. More sensible defaults, less enterprise-y, less configuration
    10. Write Tests
